Write simple and elegant program
It borns n children. Childrens are very dump: reads from file and writes to
pipe.
    parent

    file -> 1c -> pipe -> 2c -> 3c -> pipe -> ... -> lc -> pipe -> parent
    -> stdout

Parent must AT THE SAME TIME READ!!!
Death of child and parent must be detected! Data mustn't be boiled.
The size of buffers must be chosen so:

3^n * 4KB
3^(n-1) * 4KB
3^(n-2) * 4KB
3^(n-3) * 4KB

Writes are nonblock in parent and block in children.
